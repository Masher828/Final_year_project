Wonder how this module works??
Step 1 : Initially we have to download and load the mnist training data, its labels and the testing data and its labels. 
Step 2 : After that the image data cannot be fed directly into the model so we need to perform some operations and process
the data to make it ready for our neural network.
Step 3 : After that we will create our CNN model.
Step 4 : The cnn model consists of convolutional and pooling layers. It works better for data that are represented as 
grid structures, this is the reason why CNN works well for image classification problems.
Step 5 : We also have to make sure that the number of epochs is not too large as if it is large we will end up overfitting
              our model.
Step 6 : Overfitting means that our model will work on our dataset but any image outside the dataset will not be recognized
              properly.
Step 7 : Opposite of Overfitting is Underfitting in this our model cannot even recognize the image of the dataset on which 
              it is trained.
Step 8 : After the we will trained our model. It takes the training data, validation data, epochs, and batch size.
