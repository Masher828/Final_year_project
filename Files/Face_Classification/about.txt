Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial
intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human
intervention.Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past
decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly
improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times
a day without knowing it.

K- Nearest Neighbors
A supervised machine learning algorithm (as opposed to an unsupervised machine learning algorithm) is one that relies on 
labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabeled data.
Imagine a computer is a child, we are its supervisor (e.g. parent, guardian, or teacher), and we want the child (computer) 
to learn what a pig looks like. We will show the child several different pictures, some of which are pigs and the rest could 
be pictures of anything (cats, dogs, etc).
Supervised machine learning algorithms are used to solve classification or regression problems.
A classification problem has a discrete value as its output. For example, “likes pineapple on pizza” and “does not like 
pineapple on pizza” are discrete. There is no middle ground. The analogy above of teaching a child to identify a pig is 
another example of a classification problem
