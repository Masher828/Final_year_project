Face Classification
Software used: Pycharm
Libraries used: Numpy,cv2,Pandas,scikit-learn
Wonder how this module works??
Step 1 : Firstly we have to record the face of the user
    step 1.1 : For recording the face first we have to detect the face in the image
    step 1.2 : we can get the image by uploading photo to computer or we can use the web cam to capture frame of a video
    step 1.3 : we are using Haar cascades which was proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper Rapid Obejct 
               Detection using a boosted cascade of simple Features
    step 1.4 : Here we are using Haar Cascade Frontal Face Classifier to detect the face in the image.
    step 1.5 : Now we will do some preprocessing on the image.
    step 1.5 : We will store some samples of faces with the name of the person.

Step 2 : Now, we have to classify the face based on the pre-recorded faces
    step 2.1 Here we will load the faces into the ram
    step 2.2 Now we will use K-NN to classify the faces according to the features.
    step 2.3 upload image to the ram or take a frame of video captured by the front camera.
    step 2.4 now we will check to which cluster the face of the user belongs.
    step 2.5 Once the cluster is found we will return the name of the user.
