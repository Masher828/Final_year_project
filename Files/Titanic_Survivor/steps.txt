Titanic Survivor
Software used: Pycharm
Libraries used: Numpy,Pandas,OS,scikit-learn
Wonder how this module works??
Step 1 : Initially we have to download and load the train.csv file which will be available on Kaggle Website.
Step 2 : After loading the train.csv file we have to preprocessing the file to remove the columns which will be not used in
our model.
Step 3 : Then we have to divide the data into two columns input and output. Input columns contains the entries through 
which the model is trained like Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare and output columns contain the Survived class.
Step 4 : We have to divide the data because the model is trained on the basis of input columns not the basis of output 
columns.
Step 5 : Then we have to create the function of Entropy and Information gain through which we will select the root node 
of the decison tree. The feature which will have high value of information gain will be root node of Decision tree.
Step 6 : Now we will have to create the Decision tree class in this class we will making the decision tree features
on the basis of input columns. The tree features will making on the basis of how much depth we will given in the model.
Step 7 : After that we will have to predict whether the person is survive or dead on the basis of argmax value of 
information gain.
Step 8 : Now we have to trained our model on the training datasets.
