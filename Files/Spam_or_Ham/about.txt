Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial 
intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human
intervention.Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past
decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly
improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times
a day without knowing it.

This model is based on the Naiye Bayes Theorem
In this model we will build the spam classifier which can tell whether a given message is spam or not! . We can do this with 
the help of Baye's Theorem.

P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
where A and B are events P(B)≠0
-P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B without regard to each other.
-P(A|B) a conditional probability is the probability of observing event A given that B is true.
-P(B|A) is the probability of observing event B given that A is true.

In this model we have a message m = (w1, w2, . . . . , wn), where (w1, w2, . . . . , wn) is a set of unique words contained 
in the message. We need to find
           P(spam|w1⋂w2⋂...⋂wn)=P(w1⋂w2⋂...wn|spam).P(spam)/P(w1⋂w2⋂...⋂wn)

and then we will use the Bag of words to find the frequency
   P(w) = Total number of occurrences of w in dataset/Total number of words in dataset
