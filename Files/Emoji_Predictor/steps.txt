Steps to construct a model to recognize Flowers
Step 1  : Initially, we should find a dataset of different text to emoji dataset to train our model.
Step 2  : Dataset can be found on the kaggle and other similar websites.
Step 3  : Now we have to load all the emojis with their corresponding text.
Step 4  : After this we will create a architecture for model.
Step 5  : Architecture is hit and try method we have to change the epochs (number of training cycles) and architecture.
Step 6  : We can also change the number of neurons in a layer or the learning rate of the model so that we get a good 
              accuracy.
Step 7  : We will be using LSTM which is upgrade to RNN model to train our model.We have discussed about RNN and LSTM 
              in about section with the problems in RNN.
Step 8  : We have to preprocess text and emoji such that each word in sentence gets replaced by the vector and emojis 
              replaced by numbers.
Step 9  : what we mean by training our model is that it has some number of parameters and it's value gets changed on each
              epoch and accuracy also increaes.
Step 10 : We also have to make sure that the number of epochs is not too large as if it is large we will end up overfitting
              our model.
Step 11 : Overfitting means that our model will work on our dataset but any image outside the dataset will not be recognized
              properly.
Step 12 : Opposite of Overfitting is Underfitting in this our model cannot even recognize the images of the dataset on which 
              it is trained.
Step 13 : Once the model is trained we can write the text and can get the related emoticon.
